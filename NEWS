0.3.0:

* Canvas: Wrapped the properties.
* Image: Added default values for the constructors.
* Item: get_style(): refcount correction.

0.2.0:

* The pkg-config file is now called goocanvas-1.0 instead of libgoocanvas.
* The files should now be included as, for instance,
  <libgoocanvas/canvas.h>
  instead of 
  <libgoocanvasmm/canvas.h>
* Several constructors were corrected to properly initialize the underlying 
  C objects.
* The parent parameter was removed from all item constructors, 
  to avoid confusion with the unusual memory management used in the C API.
  Use add_child() instead.
* Various methods were added or improved.
